 * Provides an abstraction of an interrupt caused by some hardware condition.
 * When the external event occurs, its bit is asserted. Then if asynchronous
 * notifications are enabled, the triggered() event will fire. Otherwise the
 * bit will remain asserted until cleared or asynchronous events are enabled.
 * 
 * It is guaranteed that no other asynchronous event will occur until 
 * triggered() event handler returns.
 * 
 * The bit may be however reasserted at any time. It is the responsibility of
 * the user to ensure this doesn't case problems.
 * 
 * Note that the event handler is placed on top of current execution stack.
 * This increases the risk of overflow, therefore event handlers should defer
 * any complex processing to tasks.
