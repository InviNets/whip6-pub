*How to use SC UART (fast / non-blocking printf) on cc2650dk.*

SC UART is not a default option for cc2650dk
because it requires using a UARTâ€“USB dongle.


* Enabling it:
Add
```
define:
- PLATFORM_PRINTF_OVER_SC_UART
```
to build.spec of your app.


* Connecting a dongle:
1. Remove from SmartRF06 Evaluation Board a jumper that connects pins:
   BTN_R, BTN_L, LED_3, LED_4.
   This is the jumper that is the closest to a POWER switch.
2. Connect (using a wire) LED_3 pin on the board with RXD pin on the dongle.
3. Connect (using a wire) LED_4 pin on the board with TXD pin on the dongle.
4. Connect the dongle to a computer.
5. Use it.
   Speed: 230400
   It should appear as /dev/ttyUSB<number>.
   You can use e.g.:
	 miniterm.py /dev/ttyUSB5 230400


Full-UART works as before.
